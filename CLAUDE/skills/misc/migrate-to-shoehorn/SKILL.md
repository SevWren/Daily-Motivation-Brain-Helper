# Migrate to Shoehorn

## Why shoehorn?

`shoehorn` lets you pass partial data in tests while keeping TypeScript happy. It replaces `as` assertions with type-safe alternatives.

**Test code only.** Never use shoehorn in production code.

Problems with `as` in tests:

- Trained not to use it
- Must manually specify target type
- Double-as (`as unknown as Type`) for intentionally wrong data

## Install

```bash
npm i @total-typescript/shoehorn
```

## Migration patterns

### `as Type` → `fromPartial()`

Before:

```ts
getUser({ body: { id: "123" } } as Request);
```

After:

```ts
import { fromPartial } from "@total-typescript/shoehorn";

getUser(fromPartial({ body: { id: "123" } }));
```

### `as unknown as Type` → `fromAny()`

Before:

```ts
getUser({ body: { id: 123 } } as unknown as Request); // wrong type on purpose
```

After:

```ts
import { fromAny } from "@total-typescript/shoehorn";

getUser(fromAny({ body: { id: 123 } }));
```

## When to use each

| Function        | Use case                                           |
| --------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| `fromPartial()` | Pass partial data that still type-checks           |
| `fromAny()`     | Pass intentionally wrong data (keeps autocomplete) |
| `fromExact()`   | Force full object (swap with fromPartial later)    |

## Workflow

1. **Install**: `npm i @total-typescript/shoehorn`
2. **Find test files with `as` assertions**: `grep -r " as [A-Z]" --include="*.test.ts" --include="*.spec.ts"`
3. **Replace `as Type` with `fromPartial()`**
4. **Replace `as unknown as Type` with `fromAny()`**
5. **Add imports from `@total-typescript/shoehorn`**
6. **Run type check to verify**
